# AsthmaPredictionModel
This is a asthma prediction model.This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of asthma based on patient data such as symptoms, medical history, environmental factors, and other relevant attributes. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment, improving timely intervention and treatment outcomes. 

# Comparison of Model Performance
The asthma prediction model was evaluated using Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM. SVM performed best with 87% accuracy and an 85% cross-validation score. Logistic Regression (85%) and KNN (82%) were competitive but slightly less effective. SVM also maintained the best balance between precision and recall, making it the most reliable model.
